# Re-enable Minecraft Bedrock Achievements
A tool for allowing you to earn achievements on a Minecraft Bedrock world that has enabled cheats or used creative mode. After the program is run, cheats will be disabled and the default world game mode will be set to survival. Any players set to creative mode or changed gamerules will remain changed.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a tool for worlds on 'Minecraft for Windows', not 'Minecraft: Java Edition' or any other Minecraft Bedrock version. After the program has completed, other players on any Bedrock version will be able to join the world and unlock achievements.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Back up your worlds before using! If any corruption occurs, the worlds can then be restored.
Works on 1.21.0 Minecraft Bedrock worlds and higher. It may work on versions below, but this is untested.

## Installation
Download the latest releases from the releases section.

## Usage
The program can be run by double-clicking on the executable. This will open the command prompt and search the disk for Minecraft Bedrock worlds. You can select a world by entering the number next to the world name. The program, once completed, can be exited by pressing 'Enter'.
